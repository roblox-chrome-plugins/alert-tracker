alert-tracker
=============

This chrome extension keeps a copy of the alerts box from the header of roblox pages accesible as a browser button. Messages and friend requests are show on the button, whilst tickets and robux can be seen by clicking on the button.

The alerts are updated every 15 minutes (configurable), when the button is clicked, and when any roblox page is loaded.
